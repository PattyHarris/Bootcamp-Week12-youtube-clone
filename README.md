# Youtube Clone

This week's project is to create a Youtube clone.

## Initial Setup

1. Initial setup of Next.js and NextAuth.js is the same as prior weeks. The completed project for reference is here: https://github.com/flaviocopes/bootcamp-2022-week-12-youtube
2. Setup Prisma as before, and add tables for Subreddit.

## Endpoints

1. In this tutorial, we'll be using a different set of endpoints than what is used by Youtube (unlike how we did the Reddit clone):
   1. Homepage: `/`
   2. Subscriptions page: `/subscriptions`
   3. Channel page: `/channel/<USERNAME>`
   4. Single video page: `/video/<ID>`
